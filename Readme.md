üè¶ # Loan Approval Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant information, using logistic regression models for binary classification. Developed as part of a machine learning course project using the Loan Approval Classification dataset from Kaggle.

üìå ## Project Objectives
Predict loan approval (Loan_Status: Y/N ‚Üí 1/0)

‚öôÔ∏è ## Models Overview
Model 1 ‚Äì Baseline Logistic Regression

Uses 1 single feature

Helps understand the predictive power of a single variable

Serves as the simplest benchmark

Model 2 ‚Äì Logistic Regression with 3 Features

Uses 3 selected features (based on domain knowledge or correlation)

Provides a balance between simplicity and performance

Demonstrates how adding relevant features improves prediction

Model 3 ‚Äì Logistic Regression with Multiple Features

Uses many or all relevant features

Includes both numerical and encoded categorical variables

Maximizes model complexity and predictive capability without tuning
